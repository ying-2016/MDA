The main code of MDA.
## Prerequisite
Matlab 2019b
And we use LR classifier from LIBLINEAR, which is a library for large-scale regularized linear classification and regression
(http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear). It is very easy to use as the usage and the way of specifying parameters are the same as that
of LIBLINEAR.
